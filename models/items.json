Sure they have cookies, but there are nooks and crannies in which darkness reigns so supreme, if you merely enter, you're likely to stub your toe. And even in armored boots, that's never good. Time to light up the Dark Side with these fun 3D Deco Star Wars Wall Lights."

    "description" : "You would think a light source based off something that literally has the word \"light\" in the name would be inevitable. You were right, but we didn't just want any old light source. This was definitely a \"go big, or go home\" type situation. This floor lamp stands over five and a half feet tall. An elegant light source for a more civilized age."

    "description" : "Star Wars movies are consistently eye candy, if nothing else. Criticize any of the movies all you like, but the one part you will have a hard time talking bad about are the visuals. They are constantly stunning pieces of work and this book aims to pay homage to them by giving you a behind the scenes look at how everything came to life on the big screen."
